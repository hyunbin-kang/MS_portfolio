# Projects

About the projects I was involved in during my Master's Course.

## KSAS 2023 Spring conference talk

> Subject : Comparison of Flow Simulation over Low Reynolds Number Airfoil by Accuracy of PyFR
>
>> Intro : 
>> - In this study, aerodynamic investigation was conducted with Low Reynolds Number Airfoil of EFD-CFD workshop 5th case [*](https://efd-cfd.gitbook.io/efd-cfd-workshop). 
>> - LRN airfoil has complex flow structure, so accurate computational is needed. 
>> - In this study, We utilze the PyFR, a aerodynamic analysis framework using Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
>
>> Results :
>> - Shorter spanwise length case has pool results of lift coefficients.

>> - This result is caused by the 3-D effect of turbulent flow.
